We have written a code to fetch the tweets and it's all level replies of a particular hastag using Twitter version 2 API.

Futher we have analysed the tweets and it's replies level wise.For analysis we have used model name: "oliverguhr/german-sentiment-bert" 
We have used package named : germansentiment
<br/>
<br/>
On running Optimised extraction code file we will get 3 file <br/>
